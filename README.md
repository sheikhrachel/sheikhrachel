I am currently working on the Live Services team at Twitter, driving a ton of fun and exciting features for our new Spaces product!

I largely align myself with backend engineering, and my languages of choice are Go and Python. I am extremely interested in projects relating to video/media streaming, distributed systems, and cloud technologies.

Previously, I led engineering efforts within State Farm's RED Labs, where we built out an Alexa/mobile-based experience to connect seniors with their community of friends and loved ones, and launched it under the name Sundial. Before that, I was a software engineer at Volkswagen's Innovation Labs and The Discovery Channel.

When I'm not working on professional projects, I enjoy watching new movies/tv shows, going on adventures with my dog, and trying out new Tiktok recipes.
