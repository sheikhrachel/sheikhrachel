I am currently working on the Live Services team at Twitter. Through this team, I work on a variety of live streaming services and projects for the Twitter platform.

I largely align myself with backend engineering, and my languages of choice are Go and Python. I am extremely interested in projects relating to video/media streaming, distributed systems, and cloud technologies.

Previously, I led engineering efforts within State Farm's RED Labs, where we built out an Alexa/mobile-based experience to connect seniors with their community of friends and loved ones, and launched it under the name Sundial. Before that, I was a software engineer at Microsoft, Telos Corporation, The Discovery Channel, and Volkswagen Credit, Inc.

When I'm not working on professional projects, I enjoy watching new movies/tv shows, going hiking, cooking new recipes, and playing video games.
